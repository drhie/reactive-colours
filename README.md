# Reactive Colours
This is a puzzle game I built to familiarize myself with components, props and states. It plays around with several components, some of which include a component for buttons, boxes, score keeping, and time keeping. Many props and states are used to keep track of the many moving parts in this game.

### **Things to Build On**
1. _(Complete:)_ Create a Highest Score feature using AJAX POST and GET calls.
2. _(Complete:)_ Create a Game Over screen.
3. Break the app up into more components.
4. Include keypress functionality.
